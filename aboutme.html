        <p class="">A diligent, concise, and thoughtful graphic designer, I have nine year’s experience designing and editing information graphics and six-years experience photo editing for The Wall Street Journal. Last Autumn, I completed General Assembly’s front-end web development course and I have enjoyed finding new and interesting ways to interactively present visual data-drive trends.</p>

              <h3 class="spacing">Senior Graphics Editor, <span class="spacing italic">The Wall Street Journal,</span> London, October 2012-present</h3>
              
              <p class="spacing">I create, from conception to publication and on towards social media, intelligent and concise information graphics for web and print publications. Working with reporters and editors to produce a sophisticated visualisation, I research and analyse a wide range of data sets and economic trends, with a strong emphasis on U.K. and european economics and markets. I have recently started using new skills in front-end web development to conceive, pitch, design and produce complex interactive information graphics and find clean ways to quickly and effectively display static information graphics in a responsive online presence. Last autumn I sat on a panel at City University TKTKTKTKTKTK and discussed the benefits of team work and collaboration in unconventional  journalism.

              <p class="spacing">Until the recent launch of The Wall Street Journal’s universal global edition, I was responsible for the visual integrity and news value of The Wall Street Journal’s European edition front page. On a daily basis I undertake an intense photo edit of all major photo wire services live images to present and help determine the front-page photo for the both the print and iPad editions. I utilized this experience to coordinate with the marketing team to research and select news images that represent The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones brand identity in the News Building, 1 London Bridge Street. I have commissioned photo shoots and negotiated photo contracts on behalf of The Wall Street Journal, and manage the photo billing for the European graphics department.</p>
