            <section class="">

              <h3 class="spacing">Senior Graphics Editor, <span class="spacing italic">The Wall Street Journal,</span> London, October 2012-present</h3>
              
              <p class="spacing">I create, from conception to publication, intelligent and concise information graphics for web and print publications and on towards social media. Working with reporters and editors to produce a sophisticated visualisation, I research and analyse a wide range of datasets and economic trends, with a strong emphasis on U.K. and European economics and markets. In order to present European statistics to an American and global audience, I’ve had to utilize my precise attention to detail and ability to learn and understand a wide range of metrics and concepts.
              </p>

              <p class="spacing">Since 2014 I’ve trained in front-end web development to conceive, pitch, design and produce complex interactive information graphics and find clean ways to quickly and effectively display static information graphics in a responsive online presence. Although new to the coding world, I bring the discipline of nine years’ experience in news-driven information graphics to the Journal’s new focus on digital visualisations. Last autumn I sat on a panel at City University London and discussed the benefits of teamwork and collaboration in unconventional journalism.</p>

               <p class="spacing">From 2012 to 2015, I was responsible for the visual integrity and news value of The Wall Street Journal’s European edition front page. On a daily basis I undertake an intense photo edit of all major photo wire services live images to present and help determine the front-page photo for the both the print and iPad editions. I utilized this experience to coordinate with the marketing team to research and select news images that represent The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones brand identity in the News Building, 1 London Bridge Street. I have commissioned photo shoots and negotiated photo contracts on behalf of The Wall Street Journal, and manage the photo billing for the European graphics department.</p>
